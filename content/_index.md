# Updating Data Recipe

This site is designed to walk you through the process of setting up an automated workflow for checking and processing regularly updating data using R, git, GitHub, Travis CI, and Zenodo. It provides:

1. A template repository with the core R code for automation
2. Step by step instructions with screenshots for linking GitHub with Travis CI and Zenodo and fully automating your data pipeline

This assumes a basic knowledge of git and a GitHub account.
